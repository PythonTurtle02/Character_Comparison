# Character_Comparison
Character Comparison Between Two Strings in Python

This Python code compares two strings, text1 and text2, character by character using the zip() function to create pairs of corresponding characters and the enumerate() function to iterate through each character and its index.

The program then compares each pair of characters and prints the index of the first pair that do not match using an if statement and a formatted string.

If you uncomment the print() statements before the loop, you can see the pairs of characters and their indices that are being compared.
